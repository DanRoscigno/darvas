I had some exposure in the 80&rsquo;s as one of my roommates played, but I was about to get married and although I bought some books at the time, I never played.</p><p>My first game was a D&D Adventurers Leage<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> game at Atomic Empire<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> in Durham, NC. It was 5E, and it was a blast. I did not know the rules, but I knew that this was roleplaying, and I knew my player character&rsquo;s background because he was a Hobbit, and everyone from my generation knows Hobbits. When in doubt, do what Bilbo would have done. I brought that character, Darvas is his name, to a game that my friend Mark<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> was running. Mark has been playing since the beginning and taught me the 5E rules. Towards the end of that campaign Mark started bringing up &ldquo;old school DnD,&rdquo; but the reason did not catch in my mind because I did not know what I was missing, and I never really cared about rules, I care about the collaborative story.</p><p>My next player character is Sylceran. I think Mark had me roll up Sylceran before we finished the first campaign, and we were still using 5E. This time my character was more complicated, Sylceran was going to be a Druid, and an Elf, and at some point in his life he was going to be a (excuse me while I pull out the freaking book to see what the sub-classes are). I am back, he was going to become a member of the Circle of the Shepherd. When I originally worked all of this out, I was an expert on 5E Druids. I had spent three days reading and watching videos about which race to choose, and which subclass, and which spells, etc. Three days of my life was wasted on this, because I was just going to wing it anyway and role play. I think I told Mark about this and he probably remonded me of the OSR conversation he had brought up. Sylceran became an OSR Druid. No race, no subclass, no fluff.</p><p>Why OSR? More role-play, less wasted time, more fun.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p><a href=https://dnd.wizards.com/adventurers-league>https://dnd.wizards.com/adventurers-league</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p><a href=https://www.atomicempire.com/>https://www.atomicempire.com/</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:3><p><a href=https://tenkeepblog.blogspot.com/>https://tenkeepblog.blogspot.com/</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:3 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//osr-role-playing.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://main--sweet-figolla-586142.netlify.app/>&copy; OSR October 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
