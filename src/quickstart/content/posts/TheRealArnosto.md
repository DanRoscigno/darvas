It is not quite October yet, but I need to warm up a little
and I am moving my character sheet to this blog so that I 
can maintain it in GitHub and have it available all the time
and wherever I am.

The Real Arnosto is a Fighter/Magic User/Werewolf. Say that three
times quickly.

## Description

The Real Arnosto:

 - is about 5' tall
 - has bushy black hair
 - has a beard that keeps growing back, no matter how often he shaves
 - has bare feet, which is not uncommon in these parts
 - has hazel eyes
 - sports a minimal smile, in fact it is probably a quarter of a smirk; the only way to tell if he is happy is if you can see a sparkle in his eyes
